## First Project: analyzing_stock_data_yfinance.ipynb

### 📈 Extracting Stock Data Using Python

This project demonstrates how to **extract, analyze, and visualize stock data** using the `yfinance` library in Python.  
The lab focuses on **Apple (AAPL)** and **AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)** stock data, covering key financial concepts and hands-on data extraction techniques.

### 📝 About

A company's stock share is a piece of ownership in that company.  
- **Stock (Equity):** A security that represents ownership of a fraction of a corporation.  
- **Shares:** Units of stock.  
- **Trading:** Investors buy and sell shares daily, and prices fluctuate based on market dynamics.  
- **Ticker:** A continuously updated report of a stock's price provided by market exchanges.

As a **data scientist at a hedge fund**, your job is to detect suspicious activity in stock trading. This lab shows how to extract, clean, and explore stock data with Python

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) → To fetch stock market data.  
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) → For data manipulation and analysis.  
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) → For plotting stock trends.  
- [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) → For working with JSON datasets.  

### 📂 Data Sources

- **Live Data:** Retrieved directly from Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` API.  
- **Static Data:** Provided JSON files (`apple.json`, `amd.json`) for offline practice.
